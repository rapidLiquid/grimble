what will grimble be all about
------------------------------

a platform / website / webapp - it doesnt matter what we call it, it will have a solid backend

components

-> motivate me -> where people can seek motivation and inspiration
  -> how ???
	-> quotes, stoic philosophies, other people experiences

-> post -> people can post anything related to what hurdles they overcame/ their experiences
	-> every user can have a channel to post the content

-> follow a channel -> people can subscribe to a channel, whenever someone posts something , they will be notified

-> THE ABOVE THINGS ARE SHIT, they can be implemented later on to make it more interactive

THIS IS THE MAIN USE

--------------------

people can write what they feel, there will be options
like career, relations, and other problems people face in day to day life

lets traverse a topic - career,	
	some popular posts will be shown, generally most visited posts
	and additional options on the side will be provided
	given the option career, what are the keywords of insecurities that are there 
	the user can write something and we wil try to match the context with the data we have
	
The keyword and context will  be abstract, it wil not be related to a specific company
we will not use common nouns etc but more abstract words etc

like career -> low salary, unbearable boss, unable to find job

the main idea is clear, we will use keywords, questions to narrow down what the user wants to know about
what is it that he will read that will make him feel less insecure , that might click in his head 
and give him hope

aim of grimble -> ?????????????????????

to provide solution to the most common problems and hopefully to the more abstract problems

how will we do that , 
we need web scraping to collect data
we need text processing to clean the data
we need to derive meaning out of the data
 -> on the basis of keywords

we dont care about scale or backend or shit initially

we are a deep abstract algorithmic  company and will develop
algorithms to solve the most challenging problem,
understanding human mind and psychology
